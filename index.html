                        <p>
                            Brahmagupta ( 597- 668AD) was one such genius Astronomer - Mathematician. His father Jisnugupta was an Astrologer in the city of Bhinmal ( Rajasthan). Brahmagupta too considered himself an Astronomer however today he is remembered for his huge contributions to the field of Mathematics. By his admission, he did Mathematics or solved problems for pleasure!
                            Ujjain was the centre of Ancient Indian mathematical astronomy. Brahmagupta was the director of this centre. Brahmagupta wrote many textbooks for mathematics and astronomy while he was in Ujjain. These include ‘Durkeamynarda’ (672), ‘Khandakhadyaka’ (665), ‘Brahmasphutasiddhanta’ (628) and ‘Cadamakela’ (624). The ‘Brahmasphutasiddhanta’ meaning the ‘Corrected Treatise of Brahma’ is one of his well-known works.
                            Brahmasphutasiddhanta ((Brahma’s Correct System of Astronomy, or The Opening of the Universe.) written in 628 was his most famous work. This book has twenty-five chapters and a total of 1008 stanzas. Historians believe that the first ten were originally written by Brahmagupta because they are arranged like the typical mathematical astronomy texts in that period. It covers mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; the moon's shadow; conjunctions of the planets with each other; and conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars.
                            The remaining fifteen chapters seem to form a second work which is a major addendum to the original treatise.
                            Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text that treated zero as a number. The Greeks and Romans merely used symbols, and the Babylonians used a shell to represent nothing.
                            He gave the concept of positive numbers which he called wealth or dhan and negative numbers which he called debt or ऋण

                            He wrote the rules as follows:

                            A debt minus zero is a debt.

                            A fortune minus zero is a fortune.

                            Zero minus zero is a zero.

                            A debt subtracted from zero is a fortune.

                            A fortune subtracted from zero is a debt.

                            The product of zero multiplied by a debt or fortune is zero.

                            The product of zero multiplied by zero is zero.

                            The product or quotient of two fortunes is one fortune.

                            The product or quotient of two debts is one fortune.

                            The product or quotient of a debt and a fortune is a debt.

                            The product or quotient of a fortune and a debt is a debt.


                             Brahmagupta went yet further by considering systems of simultaneous equations (set of equations containing multiple variables) and solving quadratic equations with two variables

                        <p>
                            Aryabhata was an important figure in traditional Indian mathematics and astronomy. From the classical period forward, India has produced a long line of visionary mathematicians known as mathematicians of vision. Modern astrophysics and mathematics may trace their roots back to the research and writings linked with him, which were decades ahead of their time when they were first published.
                            Ashmaka, where Aryabhata was born in 475 AD, is recognized as the birthplace of the great Indian philosopher. Researchers are unable to pinpoint his exact birthdate, but one of his works dates from roughly 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, allowing for some reasonable guesswork. Ashmaka's birthplace is a mystery. However, Maharashtra or Dhaka may be considered. His upper-level study may have taken place in Kusumapura, and he may have resided in the region for quite some time, according to historical sources from the period. In fact, there has been some conjecture that the place known as Kusumapura might, in fact, be Pataliputra, which was the site of an important astronomical observatory.

                            Consequently, he would have spent a large amount of time here to achieve the status of the master astronomer as a consequence of this. There probably weren't many other options available to him back in the classical period, when the number of institutes teaching astronomy was probably very small. According to some historians, Aryabhata may have been in control of the Nalanda University, despite the lack of evidence to back this up. However, there are many who believe Aryabhata went on to build a real observatory at Taregana as part of the Sun temple.
                            It is almost clear that he traveled to Kusumapura for higher studies at some point and that he stayed there for a period of time. Bhaskara I (CE 629), a Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as historical records, all identify Kusumapura as Paaliputra, the contemporary city of Patna. Poemists have speculated that the university of Nalanda, situated in Pataliputra at the time, possessed an astronomical observatory, which suggests that Aryabhatta was also in charge of the university of Nalanda. Aryabhatta is also credited with establishing an observatory at the Sun Temple in Taregana, Bihar, which is still in use today.
                            The Aryabhatiya is widely regarded as Aryabhata's crowning achievement. He wrote numerous treatises throughout his career, and this was one of them. It is unfortunate that not all of what he had written is still available. Historians can only conjecture as to what could have been the tremendous importance of his works that have been lost. Mathematics and astronomy were well-represented in the Aryabhatiya, which was a comprehensive treatise. The work was saved from oblivion thanks to quotations from it in other works. In the mathematics aspect of the work, a lot of attention was paid to subjects like plane trigonometry and spherical trigonometry, as well as arithmetic, quadratic equations, and algebra.

                        <p>
                            Bhāskaracharya was a famous mathematician but not much is known about his early life except what has been inferred from his writings. Many believe that he must have been working in a school of mathematicians in Asmaka which was probably in the Nizamabad District of Andhra Pradesh. There are other references to places in India in Bhaskara's writings. There are some allusions to Valabhi (today Vala), the capital of the Maitraka dynasty in the 7th century, and Sivarajapura, which were both in Saurashtra, which today is the state of Gujarat. There is yet another school of thought which believes that he was born in Bori, in Parbhani district of Maharashtra. By and large, it is believed that Bhaskara was born in Saurashtra and later moved to Asmaka. He was tutored in astronomy by his father.

                            It is believed his father taught him astronomy. Bhaskara i is considered to be a follower of Aryabhata. He is considered to be the most important scholar of Aryabhata's astronomical school. 
                            Bhaskara i is famous for the following works:

                            <p>Zero, positional arithmetic, the approximation of sine.</p>

                            <p> The three treatises he wrote on the works of Aryabhata (476–550 CE )</p>

                            <p> The Mahabhaskariya (“Great Book of Bhaskara”)</p>

                            <p> The Laghubhaskariya (“Small Book of Bhaskara”),</p>

                            <p> The Aryabhatiyabhashya (629)</p>
                            One of the most important mathematical contributions is related to the representation of numbers in a positional system. The first positional representations were known to Indian astronomers about 500 years ago before Bhaskaracharya, but the numbers were not written in figures, but in words, symbols or pictorial representations. For example, the number 1 was given as the moon, since there is only one moon. The number 2 was represented anything in pairs; the number 5 could relate to the five senses and so on…

He explains a number given in this system, using the formula ankair api, ("in figures, this reads") by repeating it written with the first nine Brahmi numerals, using a small circle for the zero. Brahmi numerals system, dating from 3rd century B.C is an ancient system for writing numerals and are the direct graphic ancestors of the modern Indian and Hindu-Arabic numerals. Since 629, the decimal system has been known to the Indian scientists. Though Bhaskara i did not invent it, he was the first to use the Brahmi numerals in a scientific contribution in Sanskrit.
